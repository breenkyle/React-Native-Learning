Learning React Native

This repository is the collection of apps that were created as part of my guided learning for React Native. Apps are made to work on iOS and Android devices through the same code (just with small tweaks here and there). 

If you would like to test these out, please be sure to downlaod Expo and React Native on your terminal when going through, as the nodes need to be installed in these apps before they can run.
